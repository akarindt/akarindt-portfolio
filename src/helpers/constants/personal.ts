    <p>Hi! I'm Thang, also known as <strong>Akari</strong> — just another web developer trying to build cool things on the internet.</p>
    <p>I enjoy creating applications and hands-on projects, even if they're not always practical.</p>
    <p>When I'm not coding, you’ll probably find me gaming, reading, or just hanging out with friends.</p>
    <p>I love exploring new technologies and picking up new skills. If you want to chat or collaborate on something fun, don't hesitate to reach out!</p>
